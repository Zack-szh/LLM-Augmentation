# Stock Bot | LLM-Augmentation

A financial analysis system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with real-time market data using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Overview

This project creates an AI-powered financial analysis tool that:
- Fetches real-time market data from mutliple data sources using Polygon.io
- Processes and embeds financial information for efficient retrieval
- Uses LLMs to provide intelligent analysis and insights
- Implements RAG to ground AI responses in current market data

## Components

### RAG Engine
- Document processing and embedding using LangChain
- Vector storage using FAISS for efficient retrieval
